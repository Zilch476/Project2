GROUP PROJECT #2: GitHub and collaboration with code
For this project, you will use the same four groups from Project #1, with the change that we will no longer be split into Dev or Ops teams (just Group 0 – Group 3). The goal of this project is to practice the workflow of social coding — learning to collaborate within a group on a common set of data. Each team will deliver a simple website that is hosted on Github.com using the Github Pages service. Github Pages is typically used to host an informational website about a technical project; in this case, there is no technical project behind the website, but you can just write a placeholder file (like a README file) to have something in the master branch.

STEPS

Create a new repository for your project and add some placeholder data (like a README file, or a code license). You might want to consider creating a Github organization to help you manage the people in your team and privileges around your repository.

Use the GitHub Pages and Jekyll to create a website for your project: https://pages.github.com/

Start creating content. It doesn’t matter what you put here, but it should be somewhat substantive, and look polished. There should be a minimum of one content unit per team member on the site, and some images (for example, if you are using Jekyll to generate a blog, one blog post would count as a content unit). You can create a site for our course, or a pretend site for the (non-existent) technical project you created earlier, or even something completely unrelated to our class topic (like a site about a band or TV show, or collaboratively-written fiction). It’s really up to your group.

You can assign various group members to different sections or pages on the site, but an important part of social coding is learning to resolve conflicts that arise when multiple people make conflicting changes to the same file. I will be looking at the Github logs to see how these situations are resolved. You should use the collaboration tools provided by Github to assist (such as Pull requests, and the Conversation mechanism that is provided. If these situations don’t naturally occur in your project, engineer them.

We will be looking at the sites as a class next Thursday. I will be grading this project on two criteria: how much you individually contributed to the project (as evidenced by the Github records), and how broadly your team used the version control features of git and the collaboration features available in Github.
